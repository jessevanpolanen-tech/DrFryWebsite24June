// ── Sequence definitions ───────────────────────────────────────────
// A sequence is an ordered list of steps. `dayOffset` is measured from the
// moment the lead was enrolled (not from the previous send), so the cadence
// is predictable. Each step renders a plain-text email from the lead's fields.
//
// Add or edit sequences here — no schema change needed. The `id` is what you
// store on the enrollment (POST /api/enroll { sequenceId }).
//
// Links: leave them as plain https://drfry.nl/... URLs. Turn ON "Click tracking"
// in Resend → the links get wrapped automatically and clicks arrive at the
// events webhook. Don't hand-roll redirect links.

I'm Jesse from Dr. Fry. We make ProWave™ — a molecular device that extends commercial frying-oil life, so kitchens buy far less oil and dump far less waste.

In field testing with convenience-store chains in Japan we've measured meaningful oil-cost reductions per site. I'd love to show you the numbers for an operation like ${l.org || 'yours'}.

Worth a short look? Here's the field study: ${SITE}/case-study/seven-eleven` + footer(l, base),
      },
      {
        id: 'casestudy',
        dayOffset: 3,
        subject: (l) => `The FamilyMart results (2-min read)`,
        body: (l, base) =>
`Hi ${first(l.name)},

Following up with the concrete data — here's the FamilyMart demo & testing summary: ${SITE}/familymart-demo-and-testing.pdf

Short version: same oil, running clean for materially longer, with lower disposal volume. Happy to walk you through what it'd look like for ${l.org || 'your kitchens'}.` + footer(l, base),

        id: 'roi',

        subject: (l) => `Rough ROI for ${l.org || 'your sites'}`,
        body: (l, base) =>
`Hi ${first(l.name)},

I put together a quick way to estimate the savings for your volume — takes about a minute: ${SITE}/roi-calculator

If the payback looks right, the next step is a no-cost trial unit in one kitchen so you can verify it yourself.` + footer(l, base),

I don't want to crowd your inbox — this is my last note for now. If reducing fryer-oil spend is worth a 15-minute call this quarter, just reply and I'll set it up. Otherwise I'll leave you to it.

Either way, thanks for reading.
